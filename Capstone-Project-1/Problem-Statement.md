# Problem Statement:

- You work in XYZ Corporation. Your company is facing some issues and wishes for you to use Azure cloud expertise to solve them.

# Issues:

1. They wish to have a centralized store to store all their developer tools. This store should be such that developers can mount it on their file system.

2. They wish to store large volumes of image data. They wish to have low latency access to frequently accessed images i.e., images that have been accessed in the last 14 days. If an image is not accessed within the last 14 days they wish to archive them.

3. They wish to lower the latency of their website. They have noticed that users who are far away from their web server have complained that images take a lot of time to load.

4. They wish to serve another website on Azureâ€™s VMs.

5. You also want to have two VMs in different networks. They wish for you to deploy those VMs and enable communication between them.

6. They wish to use Azure to resolve their site with the domain 'simple-site.tk' to its IP address.

7. They wish for both the VMs serving their website to be more reliable so that if one VM fails the traffic is automatically routed to the other one.

8. They wish for you to find a way to assign and manage credentials for Azure for all 10 employees in the company.

9. Finally they have two applications that need to pass messages between one another on an on-demand basis i.e., an application will send the message, and other applications will receive and process it when it can.  You need to set up a service in such a way that these applications can do so (you are provided with the code). All you need to do is make changes to the config file. You need to use services from Azure Cloud to help your company resolve all these issues.
